Memory Optimization

1. Hash all training data set into memory
2. Apply cublas library for matrix multipication
3. Parallel application in N cpu threads 
 
      N = omp_get_num_threads()

4. Must allow more CPU threads than GPU devices,
   since only one single device need to used for 
   each training model, I dont want to spread CPU
   threads to multiple GPU devices.
